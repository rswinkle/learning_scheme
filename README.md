Learning Scheme
===============

What it says on the tin.

This will just be a place to store my work while working through the following books:

Little Schemer (already done though may come back to it)
Seasoned Schemer
SICP (pdf in repo)

Any other good books or exercises I hear about.

After those 3 I want to start learning Racket specific features and tools since that seems to be the most popular Scheme dialect/ecosystem these days.
